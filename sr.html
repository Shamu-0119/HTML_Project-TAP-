        <p>A warm thanks to the Force Academy team. <br>
        I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined Force Academy as a <br>
        CSR student in the month of February. My journey with Force Academy is quite different. <br>
        The trainers at Force Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts <br> 
        and help in learning programming languages from scratch.I am from the Computer Science branch, <br>
        but the teaching at Force Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from <br>
        all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers. <br>
        Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. <br>
        The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job. <br> 
        Thank you to the entire Force Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.</p></center><br><br>

    <p>After joining Force Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and my knowledge <br>
        of core Java has also improved. Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL, <br>
        HTML, and CSS in parallel.Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving <br>
        skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos. <br>
        They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc. <br> 
        I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate Technical <br>
        Consultant with a package of 3 LPA. <br> 
        Thank you FORCE ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.</p></center>
